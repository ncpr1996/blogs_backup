## Introduction

* A new technology called cloud computing has changed the way we handle, store, and use data.
    
* It means getting computing resources—such as storage, servers, and software—through the Internet.
    
* Your data is saved on computers that are connected to the Internet, not on physical devices.
    
* Cloud service providers use advanced safety features to protect your information.
    
* They make use of virtual walls (firewalls), secret codes (encryption), and rules (access limits).
    
* Even if your own gadgets are misplaced or malfunction, your data remains secure.
    
* Cloud services maintain backup copies of your data in case something goes wrong.
    
* If something goes wrong, these copies, or backups, make it easy and quick to restore your data.
    

## Types of Cloud

There are five main sorts of clouds that you might use, depending on what your business needs.

### Public Cloud

* Anyone can use it to save and retrieve information via the internet.
    
* Under the direction and control of the cloud service provider (CSP).
    
* The CSP maintains the infrastructure and guarantees the scalability and accessibility of resources.
    
* It is accessible to anyone with an internet connection, regardless of location or size of business.
    
* Users are able to run apps, save data, and access a variety of services.
    
* Customers only pay for what they use because it uses a pay-per-usage model, which is economical.
    
* Examples include Microsoft, IBM SmartCloud Enterprise, Google App Engine, Windows Azure Services Platform, and Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2).
    

**Characteristics of Public Cloud**

* Programs and data are accessible to anybody with internet access, anywhere, at any time. Because so many people share them, money and resources are saved.
    
* It is quick and easy for users to switch between resources without having to pay for them up advance.
    
* Providers maintain the technology, ensuring that security and backups function properly.
    
* They also use powerful locks, such as encryption, and routinely check to keep things safe.
    

**Advantages of Public Cloud**

* When compared to private and hybrid clouds, public clouds are more affordable.
    
* The cloud service provider takes care of maintenance, so there are no concerns for the user.
    
* It provides users with flexibility and simple integration.
    
* It is location-independent and available via the internet from any location.
    
* Highly scalable to changes in computational power requirements.
    

**Disadvantages of Public Cloud**

* The shared resources that are available to the public may make public clouds less secure.
    
* A good internet connection to the cloud provider is necessary for optimal performance.
    
* Since the supplier is in charge of managing their data, users have less control over it.
    
* The availability and service agreements of the supplier determine reliability.
    
* It may be difficult to fulfill the rules if you don't follow industry standards and guidelines.
    

### Private Cloud

* Organizations use private cloud, sometimes referred to as internal or corporate cloud, to set up and manage their own data centers.
    
* Private clouds can be implemented by businesses either within the company or by using third-party providers.
    
* When creating private clouds, opensource technologies like Eucalyptus and Openstack are frequently utilized.
    
* OpenStack, Microsoft Azure Stack, Oracle Cloud at Customer, IBM Cloud Private, and VMware vSphere are a few examples.
    

The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) splits private cloud into the following two categories based on management and location:

1. **On-premise private cloud** :
    
    * Located within the physical infrastructure of the organization.
        
    * Maintains a specialized data center with cloud services available only for internal usage.
        
    * Organizational control over the configuration and customization of the infrastructure remains unchanged.
        
    * Enables efficient handling of security and regulatory issues.
        
    * Requires expensive setup and management costs in terms of software, hardware, and IT skills.
        
2. **Outsourced private cloud** :
    
    * Involves hosting and managing the cloud infrastructure in collaboration with a third-party service provider.
        
    * The private cloud may be operated by the provider out of their own data center or at a shared location with several businesses.
        
    * Organization gains from the resources and experience of the supplier, which reduces the difficulty of managing the infrastructure.
        
    * Scalability is provided by the provider, who can modify resources based on the requirements of the enterprise.
        
    * Perfect for companies looking to benefit from private cloud features without having to pay for initial setup fees or continuous maintenance.
        
    
    Businesses have more control over their data, apps, and security with both on-premise and managed private clouds as compared to public cloud choices. Organizations with strict guidelines, sensitive data, or specialized workloads needing high levels of customisation and security are particularly suitable for private clouds.
    

**Characteristics of Private Cloud**

* Private cloud services are restricted to one company, guaranteeing unique resources and services. It is similar to having a private cloud environment set aside just for that company.
    
* Organizations now have more security and control over information management and access control.
    
* Organizations can set resources for best performance thanks to the wide customization options offered by private clouds.
    
* Private clouds provide effective resource use because they are built for smooth resource allocation and growth.
