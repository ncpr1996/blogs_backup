## Introduction

* Cloud computing is a new technology that changes how we store, use, and manage data.
    
* It means getting computing stuff, like servers, storage, and software, over the Internet.
    
* Instead of having physical machines, your data is stored on computers connected to the Internet.
    
* Companies that offer cloud services use fancy security tricks to keep your data safe.
    
* They use things like secret codes (encryption), virtual walls (firewalls), and rules (access restrictions).
    
* Your data stays safe, even if your own devices get lost or broken.
    
* If something bad happens, like your data disappears, cloud services keep extra copies.
    
* These copies (backups) help bring your data back quickly and easily if there's a problem.
    

## Types of Cloud

There are 5 different types of clouds you can use, depending on what your organization needs.
