Hundreds of cloud enthusiasts attended AWS Community Day Bengaluru 2025 on May 23, 2025. Of the many fantastic presentations, Jason Dunn's discussion about the AWS Community Builders Program caught my attention. I was excited to hear directly from Jason, the Program Manager, about the most recent developments and his guidance for prospective builders, as I am now an AWS Community Builder.

This blog is for you if you've ever wondered about the AWS Community Builders program, if you should apply, and how to get accepted. Allow me to summarize everything Jason discussed, along with additional observations based on my personal program experience.

## What is the AWS Community Builders Program?

Technical content producers that write, present, create, or contribute content regarding AWS services and related subjects are the target audience for the AWS Community Builders program. Consider it AWS's means of encouraging and enabling those who are already teaching others about cloud computing or who wish to begin doing so.

The thing is, AWS knows that the best way to learn is often from other people, not just from official guides. When someone talks about how they actually used Lambda to solve a problem or how they made their RDS database faster, it helps other developers in a way that regular classes or books might not.

The program is for people who love technology and want to share what they learn with others. You don't have to be an expert with lots of certifications, you just need to be curious and willing to learn and share your discoveries as you go.

## The Numbers Tell a Story

Jason shared some interesting stats during his talk. The slides showed that technical content creators have grown by **12 to 15%**, which is even more impressive when you consider there was a **25%** rise compared to last year. And here's something cool, India has **464 Community Builders**. That's a big number and shows how active and strong the AWS community is in the country. Being part of this group is amazing because everyone really cares about creating and sharing knowledge.

## Why Should You Join? The Benefits Are Impressive

Let's be honest, the benefits package is really good, and since I've experienced them myself, I can say they're worth it. Here's what you get when you're accepted:

## Financial and Learning Support

* I got **$500 in AWS credits** to experiment with different services and learn. I've used them to try out services I wouldn't normally test on my personal account. This has let me experiment freely without worrying about the cost.
    
* You get **one free AWS Certification voucher** for exams like Foundational, Associate, Professional, or Specialty. These vouchers usually cost between **$100 and $300**, so having one for free is really helpful.
    
* A **one-year subscription to QA (Cloud Academy)** helps with learning about the cloud. Having organized learning paths can help you grow much faster.
    
* **Exclusive swag kit** because who doesn't love AWS swag?
    

## Event Access

* A **$1,200 discount on a re:Invent ticket**. If you've ever checked the pricing for re:Invent, you know how big this savings is. re:Invent is AWS's main conference held in Las Vegas.
    
* **$500 re:Inforce ticket discount**. re:Inforce is AWS's security-focused conference.
    

### Community and Visibility

* Be included in the **public list of Community Builders.** This helps you gain visibility and trust within the AWS community.
    

Does this sound familiar? These benefits are meant to take away obstacles, like the cost of certifications, conference attendance, or trying out new AWS services.

## How the Program Helps You Grow

Beyond the actual advantages, the program also provides great chances for personal and professional growth. From my experience, these are the parts that have made the biggest difference for me.

* **Chat with other creators from all over the world on Slack**. That's where cool things happen, I've received fast help with tough problems, found people to work on projects with, and made real friends with others who love the same things.
    
* Developing skills through ongoing community meetings that include both technical knowledge and personal skills such as giving presentations and making content.
    
* You can get chances to speak at events like AWS Summits, Cloud Days, and re:Invent. Picture yourself giving a talk at one of these big conferences!
    
* Online speaking chances through Open Mic events and certain Community Builder meetings.
    
* **NDA service briefings and beta testing opportunities** give you direct access to AWS product plans. You can see new features before they are officially announced, which has helped me create content that's both timely and relevant.
    
* You also get to participate in **research and user experience feedback sessions**, such as the re:Invent catalog feedback sessions. AWS really values your opinions and wants to hear what you think.
    
* There are private events at AWS conferences like the re:Invent mixer and community dinners at some AWS Summits.
    

To be fair, these opportunities aren't just good for you, they also benefit the whole community. When you learn something new through a beta program or service briefing, you can make content that helps others understand these services once they're launched.

## The Types of Content That Matter

One slide really caught my attention during Jason's talk, it was the one about content types. The program takes in different kinds of content that help people learn about AWS.

* Articles/blogs
    
* Videos
    
* Presentations
    
* Podcasts
    
* Newsletters
    
* Open source projects
    

The main thing is that your content needs to include your name so AWS can know it's you. That makes sense because they want to recognize real people contributing, not just anonymous posts.

## What Content Actually Works

Jason was very straightforward about what kind of content is helpful for your application:

"We're thrilled you passed your certification exam, but that kind of content doesn't often help other builders learn AWS."

In simple terms, just saying "I passed my SAA-C03 exam!" isn't enough. You should create content that actually teaches others something useful. For example:

* If you gave a talk at an event, write a blog post about it
    
* If you created a video tutorial, make a blog post summarizing the key points
    
* If you're working on an open source project, document how others can use it
    

Your content should usually match the category you're trying to join. If you're applying as a containers or devtools, your content should show that you have expertise or are learning about that area.

## Application Tips: How to Stand Out

Jason's part of the presentation was really helpful. I've been through the application process myself, and I wish I had known this advice earlier. Jason explained that they look at a lot of applications, so making it easier for the reviewers to understand your application can greatly improve your chances.

### The Golden Rules

* Take your time and read each question carefully. This isn’t a race. Think about your answers and respond thoughtfully. Don't rush through it during your lunch break.
    
* You'll need a **Builder ID**, and it's free. Make sure you create one before you start your application.
    
* Use the name you're known by for your content, not the one on your official documents. If you publish as "CloudGuru Alex" but your real name is "Alexander Smith," go with the one your audience recognizes. Make sure your Builder ID, app name, and content name all match the same name.
    
* Don't use AI to write anything in the form. This is very important. Jason said, "We want the real you to come through in the app." AWS can tell if responses are made by AI, and that could hurt your chances. They want to see your unique way of thinking and your personal style.
    
* Answer all the legal questions at the end. If you don't want to get an email, they won't be able to send you one even if you're accepted or not! Pay close attention to this.
    

### Content Submission Strategy

* Personal content only, not company stuff. They want to see what you've done yourself, not your company's marketing posts.
    
* Make it easy for the people reading your work. They only have a few minutes to check things out. If it's hard to find or open, your chances of getting accepted go down.
    
* Give direct links to your content. Don’t share your main blog address or a long list of articles. Choose 2 of your best pieces.
    
* Your content needs to be available online for anyone to see right away. No links from Dropbox or Google Drive that require permission. If the person reviewing can’t open it immediately, it won’t work.
    
* Good places to post include [DEV.to](https://dev.to/) or [aws builder center](https://builder.aws.com/), but any public platform is okay.  
    I share my work on 3 platforms, and as long as the content is open and reachable, it’s fine.
    
* If your work is copied from somewhere else, it will be rejected right away. They want content you wrote yourself, original ideas, tutorials, or unique viewpoints.
    
* Try to make something that shows real-world use, even if it’s just for your own learning.  
    For example, Jason talked about organizing a rock collection. It doesn’t have to be life-changing, it just needs to show you’re building and learning.
    

## Conclusion

Hearing Jason speak directly at the AWS Community Day in Bengaluru made me even more excited about being part of this program. It's not just about the perks, it's about being part of a group of over **464 builders in India** who really care about learning and sharing what they know.

If you're considering applying, here's my tip: start making content right away, not just when the application opens. Choose your top 2 to 4 pieces, be genuine (no AI-generated stuff!), and share content that actually helps others learn. AWS gets lots of applications, but they're looking for real, passionate voices, not perfect ones.

The real benefit is the connections you make and the skills you gain. Applications usually open in January, keep an eye on the official website and good luck!
