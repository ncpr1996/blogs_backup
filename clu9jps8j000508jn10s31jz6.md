### Introduction

* **Linux File Hierarchy Structure (FHS)** : It's like a map that tells us where everything goes in a Linux computer.
    
* **Maintained by Linux Foundation** : The FHS is managed by the Linux Foundation, which makes sure everything stays organized.
    
* **Root Directory (/)** : This is the main place where all files and folders start from, no matter where they are stored.
    
* **Universal Usage** : Most of these directories are used the same way in all UNIX systems, but the FHS gives specific details for Linux systems.

1. **/ (root) :**
    
    * The computer system's root directory serves as the head of every folder.
        
    * Beginning with this root directory, which is simply a forward slash (/), all files and folders are created.
        
    * This directory is only directly editable by the root user, who is the boss.
        
    * The root directory (/) is not where the administrator stores private files. `/root` is the boss's personal folder; it is not the same as the root directory (/).
        
2. **/home :**
    
    * Each user on a computer system has a personalized place thanks to home directories.
        
    * Users save their own files, preferences, and other private information in their home directories.
        
    * Every user can freely handle their files in their own home directory, such as `/home/chandra` or `/home/prakash`.
        
    * Home directories limit access to each user's files and preferences, protecting privacy and security.
        
3. **/usr :**
    
    * This level includes the majority of user utilities and apps as well as read-only user data.
        
    * For programs at the secondary level, it contains source code, libraries, documentation, and binaries.
        
    * Key directories for user programs include :
        
        * `/usr/bin`: Holds binary files for user programs like `at`, `awk`, `cc`, `less`, and `scp`.
            
        * `/usr/sbin`: Contains binary files for system administrators such as `atd`, `cron`, `sshd`, `useradd`, and `userdel`.
            
        * `/usr/lib`: Stores libraries for programs in `/usr/bin` and `/usr/sbin`.
            
    * User-installed programs are typically found in:
        
        * `/usr/local`: This directory houses user-installed programs, typically installed from source code. For example, Apache web server installations go under `/usr/local/apache2`.
            
    * Key system resources, such as header files, the Linux kernel code, and documentation, can be found in:
        
        * `/usr/src`: Documentation, header files, and Linux kernel sources are all contained in this directory.
            
4. **/etc :**
    
    * These are unique files that impact the entire system and are unique to the computer they are on.
        
    * They contain crucial configurations that are required by every installed program on the system.
        
    * Scripts that manage how apps launch and terminate at computer startup and shutdown are also located in this directory.
        
    * Some examples include `/etc/resolv.conf`, which stores DNS server settings, and `/etc/logrotate.conf`, which configures log rotation settings.
        
5. **/root :**
    
    * The root user, who has complete authority over the system, keeps this directory private.
        
    * This directory's contents can only be accessed and changed by the root user.
        
    * It functions as a secret space where the root user stores and manages sensitive system configurations and files.
        
    * It is not the same as the top-level directory for the entire file system, the root directory (/).
        
6. **/opt :**
    
    * These are additional software applications that you may or may not need, but that you may like to install for particular uses or purposes.
        
    * Several apps that are not part of the operating system are stored in this directory and come from different sources.
        
    * Installing add-on programs should take place in a subdirectory of `/opt/` or directly under the `/opt/` directory. They remain divided from the main system files as a result.
        
7. **/lib :**
    
    * Important libraries that are required for the correct operation of programs in `/bin/` and `/sbin/` are kept in this directory.
        
    * This directory contains libraries that are essential to running programs from `/bin/` and `/sbin/`.
        
    * Library filenames typically start with "ld\*" or "lib\*.so.\*".
        
8. **/boot :**
    
    * The files in this directory are necessary for the operating system to boot up.
        
    * These are the files, such as kernels and initial RAM disk (.initrd) files, required by the boot loader.
        
    * Here are some important files: GRUB, vmlinux, and kernel initrd.
        
    * **Bootloader :**
        
        * A bootloader is a brief software application that launches with your machine. It is the first application to launch when the system boots up.
            
        * Locating and loading the operating system into memory is its primary duty. It finds the kernel and necessary files for the operating system to boot up.
            
        * In addition, the bootloader manages hardware initialization, making sure that all necessary hardware parts are set up correctly before the operating system takes over.
            
        * A boot menu is provided by certain bootloaders, such GRUB (GRand Unified Bootloader). Users have freedom at starting by being able to select from a variety of operating systems or boot settings via this menu. Because it enables users to boot into several operating systems that are installed on the computer, GRUB is especially flexible.
            
        * Other bootloaders such as LILO, Syslinux, rEFInd, and UEFI exist in addition to GRUB. With a range of features and functionalities, each responds to particular needs and tastes.
            
9. **/sbin :**
    
    * The system binaries included in this directory are essential for system maintenance and operation.
        
    * Just like the `/bin` directory, `/sbin` also stores binary executable files.
        
    * System administrators usually use these commands to perform routine maintenance on the system.
        
    * Some examples of commands found in this directory include `fsck`, `init`, `shutdown`, `reboot`, `fdisk`, `ifconfig`.
        
10. **/bin :**
    
    * The command binaries required for system operation, including those needed in single-user mode, are stored in this directory.
        
    * Many common Linux commands, such as `cat`, `ls`, and `cp` are stored here. These commands are frequently used for various system tasks and operations.
        
    * Commands located in `/bin` are accessible to all users of the system. Examples include `ps`, `ping`, `grep`, and `cp` , which are used by all users for different purposes.
        
11. **/var :**
    
    * The system uses changing data files stored in this directory while it operates.
        
    * It is the location where the system stores logs, temporary data, and other items that are subject to frequent changes while the system is operating.
        
    * Files such as system logs, pending emails, and temporary files can be found inside `/var`.
        
    * Users and system applications save and retrieve data via `/var`. Maintaining this directory correctly is essential to the system's functionality.
        
12. **/mnt :**
    
    * Users can temporarily mount network sites or external devices in this directory.
        
    * It acts as a point of connection between the system and devices such as network shares, USB drives, and external hard drives.
        
    * In order to access the contents of devices like USB drives or network folders, users frequently mount them to /mnt.
        
    * It serves as a temporary location for external data access. The files are removed from `/mnt` whenever the device or location is unmounted.
        
13. **/media :**
    
    * The system automatically mounts external devices, such as optical discs and USB drives, in this directory.
        
    * It's where, when you add in devices like USB drives or CDs, the system connects automatically and displays content from those sources.
        
    * The files on a USB drive or CD will appear under `/media` so you can quickly access them when you plug them in.
        
    * It serves as a space for short-term external device storage. The files vanish from `/media` as soon as the device is removed.
        
14. **/tmp :**
    
    * Temporary files that are required while programs are running are kept in this directory.
        
    * It functions similarly to a short-term storage space where programs can store files they require temporarily.
        
    * Programs may utilize the `/tmp` directory to hold temporary files while they are operating, such as while processing data or downloading files.
        
    * To prevent permanently filling up your storage, files in `/tmp` are typically automatically erased when your computer restarts or after a predetermined period of time.

### Conclusion

* Files are easily found and managed in Linux thanks to its clean file organization into directories.
    
* Various directories perform different functions, such as storing temporary files (`/tmp`), storing changing data (`/var`), or containing critical programs (`/bin`).
    
* Users can add their own stuff in places like `/usr/local` or connect external devices in `/mnt` and `/media`, making Linux work just how they want.
    
* directories like `/home` give everyone their own space to keep their files safe, while `/boot` has what's needed to start up the system smoothly.
    
* It's crucial to take care of folders like `/var` and `/tmp` to keep the system stable and secure, as they handle important data and temporary files. Regular cleanup and following good practices help keep Linux running well.
