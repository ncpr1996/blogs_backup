## **Why This Session Instantly Hooked Me**

I spent my Saturday at the AWS User Group Chennai meetup, and one session really caught my attention: a detailed look at **Amazon Bedrock AgentCore** and how it helps in creating real AI agents.

The speaker, **Muthukumar Oman, who is the VP – Head of Engineering** at Intellect Design Arena and an **AWS Community Builder**, explained how to take an AI model from a basic demo to a fully working AI agent in a clear and organized way.

There were other good talks that day, but this one stood out because it addressed a question many of us have been thinking about: How can we go beyond simple chatbots and actually build a dependable AI agent that works with our systems?

## **What Is Amazon Bedrock AgentCore?**

### **Making Sense of AgentCore in Simple Terms**

AgentCore acts as the main control center for your AI agents on AWS.

It helps you:

* Deploy and operate agents securely at scale
    
* Ensure trust and reliability when agents call tools and APIs
    
* Use built-in tools like a code interpreter and browser
    
* Stay framework- and model-agnostic, so you can bring your favorite stack
    
* Test and monitor agents in a structured way​
    

Imagine it this way: if a regular LLM is like a smart intern, AgentCore is like the IT, security, and support team that helps that intern use different apps, keeps track of their work, and makes sure everything stays secure.

### **Where AgentCore Fits in the AI Stack**

One of the slides showed the full AI structure on AWS: applications at the top, followed by AI and agent development tools and services, then Amazon Bedrock (which includes models, features, and AgentCore), and finally the underlying infrastructure such as Amazon SageMaker and AI compute resources like Trainium, Inferentia, and GPUs.

In other words:

* **Infrastructure** = raw compute and ML tooling
    
* **Bedrock** = models and agent building blocks
    
* **AgentCore** = runtime, memory, gateway, observability, and identity for agents
    
* **Applications** = what your users actually interact with (like support bots, internal copilots, etc.)
    

## **Core Building Blocks of AgentCore**

### AgentCore Runtime – The Engine Behind the Agent

The AgentCore Runtime slide explained what happens when your agent starts working.

Key points that stood out:

* Framework agnostic – you’re not locked into a specific agent framework
    
* Model flexibility – you can plug in different models
    
* Protocol support, extended execution time, and enhanced payload handling
    
* Session isolation, built-in authentication, and agent-specific observability
    
* Unified set of agent-specific capabilities​
    

There was also a diagram showing how your agent or tool code, like a Python framework, is structured.

1. Packaged as a container
    
2. Pushed to ECR
    
3. Exposed via an AgentCore endpoint
    
4. Connected to a model and the Bedrock AgentCore runtime​
    

Imagine deploying a microservice: you package your code into a container, send it out, and AgentCore connects it to models and tools.

### **Memory – Short-Term vs Long-Term**

This part really caught my attention. The speaker divided AgentCore Memory into different parts.

* **Short-term memory**
    
    * Immediate context
        
    * In-session knowledge accumulation​
        
* **Long-term memory**
    
    * User preferences
        
    * Semantic facts
        
    * Summary​
        

In the architecture view, short-term memory stored things like chat messages and session details, while long-term memory kept semantic data, user preferences, and summaries.

Another slide showed how long-term memory functions:

* Short-term memory = raw storage
    
* Long-term memory = vector storage
    
* A memory extraction module finds relevant information based on events and strategies, combines it, and then creates an embedded version that can be searched.
    

Imagine your agent is like a person:

* Short-term memory is about the conversation you're currently having.
    
* Long-term memory is about what I’ve learned about you from previous chats and over time.
    

For a banking or e-commerce assistant, this could mean remembering:

* Your preferred language
    
* The kind of products you usually buy
    
* Important facts like “this user prefers digital invoices”
    

## **Built-In Tools: Code Interpreter and Browser**

### **Code Interpreter – Let the Agent Safely Run Code**

The Code Interpreter slides explained how an agent can safely run code within a sandbox environment.

The architecture was roughly:

1. User sends a query to the agent
    
2. Agent invokes the LLM
    
3. LLM selects the Code Interpreter tool and creates a session
    
4. Code runs inside a sandboxed environment with a file system and shell
    
5. Telemetry flows into observability
    
6. Results are returned to the user​
    

The Code Interpreter capabilities listed included:

* Secure sandbox execution
    
* Multi-language support
    
* Scalable data processing
    
* Enhanced problem-solving
    
* Structured data formats
    
* Ability to handle complex workflows​
    

Imagine giving your agent a temporary, secure laptop where it can execute scripts, handle CSV files, or process data, while you keep a close watch on everything.

### **Browser Tool – Let the Agent Navigate the Web or Apps**

Another built-in tool is the **Browser Tool**.​

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1766644409580/112931a3-9295-43eb-b0d1-06a34d37e0d0.jpeg align="center")

The flow looked like this:

1. User sends a query (e.g., “Buy shoes on Amazon”)
    
2. Agent invokes the LLM
    
3. LLM chooses the browser tool
    
4. Commands like “click left at (x, y)” are generated
    
5. A library (e.g., browser automation) translates these into real actions
    
6. The browser executes them and sends screenshots/results back to the agent​
    

The Browser Tool capabilities mentioned:

* Resource and session management
    
* Rendering live view using AWS DCV web client
    
* Observability and session replay​
    

In simple terms: your agent can actually interact with a user interface, not just describe it. This is really important when dealing with older systems inside a company that might not have APIs available.

## **Gateway, Identity, and Observability – Production-Ready Concerns**

### **AgentCore Gateway – One Door for All Tools**

The AgentCore Gateway shows how agents connect to tools and APIs in a single, unified way.

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1766644462557/63500ea3-ded8-454c-9007-254e569101c5.jpeg align="center")

Key ideas from the slides:

* Simplified tool development and integration
    
* Unified tools access and semantic tool selection
    
* Security guard and serverless infrastructure
    
* Tool types: OpenAPI specs, Lambda functions, Smithy models​
    

Architecturally, the gateway:

* Sits between agents and APIs/tools
    
* Handles inbound authentication (via tokens)
    
* Routes to different targets: Smithy, OpenAPI, AWS Lambda
    
* Integrates with Identity for credentials and CloudWatch for observability​
    

If you've ever connected an LLM to many APIs by hand, you know how frustrating that can be. The gateway acts like a main router and enforces rules for using tools.

### **AgentCore Identity – Who Is This Agent, Really?**

Identity is managed through AgentCore Identity, which focuses on:

* Centralized agent identity management
    
* Credentials storage
    
* OAuth 2.0
    
* Identity and access controls
    
* SDK integration
    
* Request verification security​
    

It’s like IAM, but better suited for agents and their tools: agents don’t just randomly call APIs; they do so with proper authentication, limited access credentials, and verified requests.

### **AgentCore Observability – Seeing What Your Agent Is Doing**

Observability was another big emphasis:

* OTEL-compatible
    
* Runtime metrics
    
* Memory metrics
    
* Gateway metrics
    
* Tools metrics
    
* Sessions, traces, spans​
    

In short, you don’t have to guess what’s happening. You can track how an agent handled a user request, which tools it used, how long each step took, and where things went wrong.

## **Strands Agents vs Bedrock Agents vs AgentCore**

One slide compared Strands Agents, Bedrock Agents, and AgentCore based on several different factors.

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1766643603463/12a9af99-5fd1-4aab-ac6c-93b8bf2ef987.jpeg align="center")

So, if you’re:

* **Experimenting quickly** → Strands may be fine.
    
* **Shipping something fast** → Bedrock Agents are convenient.
    
* **Building enterprise-grade, highly customized agents** → AgentCore gives you more control while still leaning on AWS-managed pieces.
    

## **How All of This Comes Together for Real-World Apps**

### From “Toy Chatbot” to Production Agent

The speaker used several diagrams showing how an app communicates with AgentCore Runtime, which then interacts with:

* Models
    
* Memory
    
* Gateway
    
* Identity
    
* Observability​
    

In real situations, this allows you to create use cases like:

* A customer support agent that keeps track of past conversations and user preferences.
    
* A financial assistant that uses browser tools to access internal systems and retrieves data safely.
    
* A developer assistant that runs code using the code interpreter and records all actions for review.
    

### **Why This Matters for Builders Like Us**

If you're creating a startup product or working in a team within a large company, the usual challenges are similar:

* “How do I handle sessions and memory in a reliable way?”
    
* “How can I link agents to different tools without causing serious security issues?”
    
* “How do I figure out what went wrong when something doesn’t work as expected?”
    

AgentCore helps solve these problems by:

* Structured runtimes and memory
    
* Gateway and identity for secure tool access
    
* Deep observability for traces and metrics
    

In the end, it takes AI agents from being a makeshift side project to something that operations, security, and compliance teams can really trust and use.

## **Conclusion**

Amazon Bedrock AgentCore showed me that creating strong AI agents isn't just about making another chatbot. It's more about getting the basics right, like memory, tools, security, and the ability to track what's happening. When runtime, gateway, identity, and built-in tools all work together, they form a solid base. This helps move from quick weekend projects to real, reliable AI experiences that teams can trust and grow.
